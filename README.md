# Periodic Table Website  - Responsive Design
**HTML and CSS**

In this project I was required to create a periodic table of elements, incorporating responsive design using only HTML and CSS.
It resizes according to screen dimentions and has a media query which forces a static image to replace the code when the website reaches a certain break point.
I decided to use CSS grid in the construction of this website for the responsiveness element, so that the table keeps it's structure well.

**Outcome**
